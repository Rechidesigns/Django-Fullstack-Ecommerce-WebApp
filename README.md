# Django-Fullstack-Ecommerce-WebApp
Creating a fullstack django application, html, css and a bit of javascrip was used to get this done. 
By doing so i created a template folder and a static folder into my django application. 
The template folder contains html files and the static folder contains the images and css files. 
The app can basically function like every other ecommerce website such as jumia and konga, like having products, categories and cutomers data, cart etc. 
Finnally, this project was my capstone project as a backend eveloper at Univelcity.
